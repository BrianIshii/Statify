### Statify

Statify is a web app that will pull data from Spotify to give listening insights to its users. Users will be able to login with Spotify, giving us access to Spotify’s API endpoints to gather information about the user’s listening habits. After gathering and curating this data, we can highlight interesting listening trends based on many different factors such as location, genre, age, and more. In addition, we plan on integrating machine learning algorithms to suggest new music for the users to listen to. 


List the language and technologies:
- Django
- Angular or React
- Bootstrap
- SQL
- Git
- Agile Scrum
- Jenkins
